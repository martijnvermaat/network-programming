\paragraph{Question 1}
Issue 1: connection counter in shared memory? depends on what you mean by 'count' and
what the connection consists of.
Issue 2: writing to a socket (file descriptor) may write less bytes at a time than
provided. (also for reading)

Yes, concurrent requests will be processed correctly, but accepted iteratively one at a
time. Processing of connections can be done concurrently.

\paragraph{Question 2}
Issue 1: connection counter must be in shared memory (alternative might be pipes).
Issue 2: mutual exclusion for the connection counter.
Issue 3: be carefull where and when to remove semaphores and shared memory. always try
to clean up, but not too soon (e.g. within a child process).

Yes, concurrent requests will be processed correctly, and accepted and processed
concurrently.
